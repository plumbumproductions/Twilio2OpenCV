# TO DO

- Add OCV layer to template?  Use in TriggeredByS3

- CNAME for API endpoint URL (the one used by twilio)

- learn about prod and dev

- table structure, primary and sort keys, etc... Before t2ocv?

- build out missing functionality
	- Add user
	- Add face (w/name) to face index

- can the triggers/events be more finely tuned?

- "Additionally I’m passing Twilio’s X-Twilio-Signature HTTP header through as “event.Signature” so you can properly validate the request as being from Twilio for full security."
